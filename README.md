# React Starter

React Starter is intended to be used in conjunction with Express Starter to mimic a deployed environment. It also works perfectly fine as a standalone application but out-of-the-box, it expects Express Server to be running in order to fetch an image. If it isn't running, you will see a fetch error for an image on the landing page.
